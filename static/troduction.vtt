00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.850
Hello Alice, how long have you been here in China?

2
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.680
Oh, I’ve been here for quite a long time.

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.920
I’ve been here over five years right now.

4
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.640
Wow, five years, such a long time.

5
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.940
Yeah, quite a long time.

6
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.250
So do you get used to everything here in China?

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.400
I do think so, yes.

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.350
When I arrived, I had such crazy shock about China and new culture,

9
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.870
and I was trying to get used to it,

10
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620
so for the first month I was just hiding from the world.

11
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.710
Oh, really!

12
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.840
Yes, that was, that was shocking to me.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.150
But now I get used to it and know more like Chinese.

14
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.290
Okay. So do you have something that you are still not very getting used to that?

15
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.560
Uh, I don’t think so, but I do still have some struggles.

16
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.520
Okay, what kind of struggles?

17
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.360
Like language barrier.

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.690
Language barrier, oh.

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.200
Yeah, I just feel like I’ve been studying Chinese for a long time,

20
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.460
but sometimes I just going to do some grocery shopping or just going to the bank

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.060
and they still don’t understand me.

22
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.450
Ah, really?

23
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.120
Yeah, It’s so annoying.

24
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.000
Yeah.

25
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.390
I feel like, I have been to China for such a long time

26
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.780
and they still don’t understand me.

27
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.770
Ah, okay.

28
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.580
So I have to improve my Chinese language skill.

29
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.090
Yeah, improve your Chinese skill maybe.

30
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.840
So where are you from in China?

31
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.430
I’m from Shanghai.

32
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.500
From Shanghai?

33
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.480
Yeah, right. But I’ve been an exchange student in Germany last semester.

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.770
Oh, that’s so your English is so great.

35
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.640
Ah, thank you!

36
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:41.720
I was surprised, yes.

37
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.260
So what did you do in Germany?

38
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.780
I just...also learned English majors, and chose some courses related to that,

39
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.510
but I still like, have the culture shock like you have just mentioned.

40
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.690
Wow, so what kind of shock did you have?

41
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.390
Oh, it’s very interesting, you know, because in China,

42
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.570
while you are having classes, or you like someone is giving a presentation later,

43
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.390
and you usually clap your hands to show your appreciation,

44
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.850
but in Germany like, every when the class is over,

45
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.460
or someone is giving their presentations,

46
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.020
they just knock on the tables!

47
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.540
So the first time when I was in there,

48
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.620
I just heard the noise from the knocking sounds,

49
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.600
and I used to clap my hands,

50
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.620
and what is even more interesting is that when I went back to China,

51
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.000
and I also like, after someone’s giving a presentation,

52
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.230
I also started to knock on the table,

53
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.510
but the truth is that everyone is clapping their hands.

54
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.960
Wow, this is so interesting, so you should be loud and they just applauding.

55
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.680
But in China you also knock table when you are drinking Baijiu right?

56
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.860
Yeah, right, when doing a prost, or to celebrate something. Yeah, right.

57
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.780
That’s lovely!

58
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.410
Yeah, so Alice, when you went back to Russia,

59
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.190
do you still have something that you very miss in China?

60
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270
Oh I do lots of things I miss about China

61
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.550
I cannot survive without Chinese food anymore.

62
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.780
Oh really, Chinese food is really good.

63
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.810
Yeah, and I’m in love with Chinese retired people,

64
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.290
because they are so positive and optimistic,

65
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.880
they know how to use applications,

66
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.950
they do sports and dance on the street every night,

67
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.000
I missed it in Russia so much.

68
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.290
Ah, Really!

69
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.430
Yes!

70
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.040
So that’s why you stay in China for so many years!

71
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.750
Yeah, China feels like my second home right now.

72
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.820
Ah really!

73
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.570
Would like to go back to Germany?

74
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.680
Maybe. Future or sometime, maybe.

75
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.880
But not to live there right?

76
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.650
Yeah, maybe not to live there.

77
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.530
I still love my hometown, China.

78
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.880
I can understand that,

79
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.590
Chinese culture is the most ancient one, worth observing.

80
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.540
Yeah!

81
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.460
Okay that’s very nice meeting you David.

82
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.420
Yeah, nice to meet you!

83
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.240
I have to go to classes, bye bye!
